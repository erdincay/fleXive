            Quite often it is desireable to adjust (or automatically generate) some values in a content instance, send
            emails or perform functionality that the original developer of a software component didn't have in mind when
            he wrote it. Changing the component is one way - but this neither endorses reusability of the component nor
            the modification of the required actions.

            &Flexive; is built with the intention to allow various kinds of scripting. Scripts can be either executed
            manually (on demand) or when a certain event occurs. The scope of events are defined in
            <constant>FxScriptScope</constant>
            for
            <link linkend="core_structure">types, assignments</link>, binary processing,
            <link linkend="core_users">user accounts</link>
            or
            <link linkend="core_tree">tree</link>
            actions.
        </para>
        <para>
            The scripting language of choice is
            <link xlink:href="$1">$2</link>, but if JavaSE 6 or higher is used any language
            supported by the Java Scripting API can be used.

            Scripts that are not executed manually or on demand are supplied with context dependent variables in so
            called
            <constant>bindings</constant>. A script that is called before a content instance is saved will for example
            require a reference to the content instance in its bindings.

        <para>
            &Flexive; allows the definition of scripts which are executed once during the initial setup of a division
            (database) called
            <emphasis>run-once</emphasis>
            scripts, or for every time the application server is started called
            <emphasis>startup</emphasis>
            scripts.
            These scripts are located in the
            <filename>resources/scripts/runonce</filename>
            and
            <filename>resources/scripts/startup</filename>
            directories for applications extending &flexive; and in
            <filename>src/framework/resources/fxresources/scripts/runonce</filename>
            and
            <filename>src/framework/resources/fxresources/scripts/startup</filename>
            for the framework itself.
