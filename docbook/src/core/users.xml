    <para>Handling users and user information is a basic business of virtually every major software system in use today. At this juncture fleXive is no exception.
        User management in fleXive is based on accounts – that is a user and its basic information (name, login name, contact data, e-mail addresss, ...) are stored in accounts.
    </para>
    <para>
        In the table below you see the listing of all attributes an account in fleXive owns.

        There are two system defined accounts:

        <itemizedlist mark='bullet'>

            <listitem>
                <para>the guest user. Everyone who is not logged in is treated as GUEST.

            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para>the supervisor. This user is in all roles and may operate on all mandators.
                </para>
            </listitem>

        </itemizedlist>

        These two accounts can not be removed.

    </para>

    <para>In the following we will look at how to create, update and remove accounts.</para>


    <section>
        <title>Creating an user</title>
        <para>
            Creating an user requires special rights. More precisely only callers in role ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT may create users, and only for their mandator. An exception is a user with the role GLOBAL_SUPERVISOR who may create users for all mandators.
            Following you see an example of how to create an user.
        </para>

        <para>
            <code>
<literallayout>
private AccountEngine ae = EJBLookup.getAccountEngine();
ae.create(“Administrator”, “admin”, “pw123”, “admin@flexive.org”, 1, 1, true, true, SYSDATE, “”, -1, “Administrator account”, false, false);
</literallayout>
            </code>
        </para>

        <para>

            After the account creation one can assign the roles the account is in and the groups it belongs to. For a detailed explanation of the meaning and functioning of roles and groups please go to the <xref linkend="core_security"/>.

        </para>


        <para>

            For assigning a role to an account the following rules apply:

            <itemizedlist mark='bullet'>

                <listitem>
                    <para>the caller must be in role ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
                    </para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                    <para>the account/user has to belong to the callers mandator
                    </para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                    <para>the caller may only assign roles that he is assigned to himself
                    </para>
                </listitem>

            </itemizedlist>

            GROUP_GLOBAL_SUPERVISOR may set the roles for all users in the system.

        </para>

        <para>
            Assigning a group to an account presumes the following prerequisites:

            <itemizedlist mark='bullet'>

                <listitem>
                    <para>the caller must be in role ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
                    </para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                    <para>the account/user has to belong to the callers mandator
                    </para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                    <para>the caller may only assign groups that also belong to his mandator, plus GROUP_EVERYONE and GROUP_OWNER
                    </para>
                </listitem>

            </itemizedlist>

            GROUP_GLOBAL_SUPERVISOR may set all groups for all users. Note that by default a newly created account is assigned to the group EVERYONE. To get more information about groups go to the <xref linkend="core_security"/>.

        </para>

    <section>
        <title>Updating an user</title>
        <para>
            &flexive; provides two methods for updating an account. One is for updating only some personal data of the specified user (name, login name, password, e-mail address, and language). The other one lets you update all attributes of the user. For both methods applies: setting one parameter to null in the method call means keeping its original value (i.e. the value of the corresponding account attribute is not changed).
        </para>
        <para>
            The following code updates the previously created administrator account (ID 1) by setting its name to “System administrator” and its e-mail address to “sysadmin@flexive.org”. Note that by setting the parameters password, login name and language to null the original values (“pw123”, “admin”, 1) are preserved.
        </para>
        <para>
            <code>
<literallayout>
private AccountEngine ae = EJBLookup.getAccountEngine();
ae.update(1, null, “System administrator”, null, sysadmin@flexive.org, null);
</literallayout>
            </code>
        </para>
    </section>


    <section>
        <title>Removing an user</title>
        <para>
            There are two prerequisites for the caller to remove an account:

            <itemizedlist mark='bullet'>

                <listitem>
                    <para>the caller must be in role ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
                    </para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                    <para>the account/user has to belong to the callers mandator
                    </para>
                </listitem>

            </itemizedlist>

            GlobalSupervisor may remove users belonging to any mandator. The accounts USER_GUEST and USER_GLOBAL_SUPERVISOR may not be removed in any case.

        </para>
        <para>For removing an account one only needs to know the account ID. Thus removing the previously created and updated administrator account works as follows:</para>
        <para>
            <code>
<literallayout>
private AccountEngine ae = EJBLookup.getAccountEngine();
ae.remove(admin_id);
</literallayout>
            </code>
        </para>
